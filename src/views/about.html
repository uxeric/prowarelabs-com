        <p class="margin10">Proware founder and CEO John Dagenais is the leader of a construction company and was
          chatting with a good friend and mayor of a local Ottawa municipality who voiced his frustration with the
          issues and delays surrounding municipal building permits. It was out of this conversation that the idea for
          Proware was born â€¦ there had to be a better way!</p>
