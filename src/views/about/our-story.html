        <h4 class="price_product">There had to be a better way!</h4>
        <p class="margin10 bottom25">Proware founder and CEO John Dagenais is the leader of a construction company and was constantly frustrated with the issues and delays surrounding municipal building permits. He was chatting with a good friend and mayor of a local Ottawa municipality and expressing his frustration. It was out of this conversation that the idea for Proware was born â€¦ there had to be a better way!</p>

            <p>Proware was designed and built from the ground up to help municipalities serve their clients better. Proware products; ProInspector and Pro Maintenance enable smoother more efficient and transparent permit workflows for all stakeholders in municipal planning and develpment. The Proware solutions provided a valuable tool to help municipal employees improve their service levels and responsiveness to their customers (building and construction companies).</p>
            <p>As the product grew and evolved it was adopted by many Ontario municipalities and has proven to provide value to more than just permit workflows. The ability to improve permit workflows and therefore payments also had the impact of improving cash flow for city administrators and finance departments. Proware provides value to CAO and helps improve receivable time by enabling more efficient and permit flow and reducing the number of errors. Improved permit workflow and fee collection improve cash flow for municipalities.</p>
            <p>After ten years in business Proware continues to deliver value to all stakeholders in the planning development and building community. We are committed to enabling municipalities to improve and digitize their works flows which enables them to provide a higher level of service to their clients. Our team is growing and we are excited about providing simple, beautiful software to even more municipal clients in the coming year.</p>
